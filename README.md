#### High Yield Investment Program multi-agent simulation

A high-yield investment program (HYIP) is a type of Ponzi scheme, an investment scam that promises unsustainably high return on investment by paying previous investors with the money invested by new investors. Most of these scams work from anonymous offshore bases which make them hard to track down.

#### Acknowledgements

Simulation was creating using parts of 'Credibility Game' (Paulina Adamska, PJWSTK 2013) and 2nd version of 'Credibility Game' project (Adamska, Kowalik, PJWSTK 2014). Plus some of the HYIP code creating in cooperation with Grzegorz Kowalik (PJWSTK, 2014).

#### Simulation description

In the simulator we use a simulation model which would indicate the most effective strategies for HYIP owners to maximize their profit when running away. It also investigates the influence of investing in proper script and advertisement on HYIPâ€™s financial results. The model is, to a large extent, based on real-life data, acquired from HYIP monitors and forums.

##### Simulation workflow

To investigate the phenomena of HYIPs (especially to analyse the strategies that HYIP owner can take to decide when run away with money), we designed a simulation which contains elements of evolution. After every generation of HYIPs, the effectiveness in terms of increasing balance account is verified and the best strategies are inherited by next generation.
